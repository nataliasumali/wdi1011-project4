### What is wdi1011-project4?

If you are a student of WDI-GA cohort 10-11, you are familiar with our instructor's Alex PlanetApp. Well, **wdi1011-project4** is the re-creation of PlanetApp scaled down from universe to the earth. Having said that... 

**wdi1011-project4** is a fun little app where you can enter a latitude and a longitude of a specific location, hit the 'go' button, and get different pictures from *instagram*. Once you get pictures, you can then click on the link below each picture/image to see the _google map_ and find out where you are on earth. Several latitudes and longitudes are provided for you to pick and choose to get you started. Start exploring the earth!

### Directions

1. Go to http://fierce-hamlet-6820.herokuapp.com
2. Click on the word **e x p l o r e**
3. You will see a list of latitudes on the left side of the screen and a list of longitudes on the right. 
4. **Highlight** a latitude of your choice, **drag and drop** it to the text box. Do likewise with the longitude of same background color. 
   * Little secret: you can mix and match latitude and longitude. Sometimes it will render a random place that then you can explore. Most of the times they don't render anything though... Sad...
5. Hit **'go'** button.
6. Pictures should appear.
7. Click on the **latitudes, longitudes** below each image to see where you are on earth.
8. A **pop-up** window should appear, showing a **map** with a **marker** of the image's location.
9. You can also type in manually any latitude and longitude of your choice. 
10. Have Fun!!!
